# NBA_Rookie_Clustering

## Overview
This project focuses on attempting to evaluate NBA players' rookie season performance. I look at every player's rookie season stats going back to the 1979-1980 NBA season and compare them against each other to see the best and worst of rookie players for the past 40 years. There are some interesting questions this may be able to answer.... Which NBA players were the best rookies? How good was the very hyped Zion Williamson? Which NBA players were the most similar to each other as rookies? Do certain clusters of players show a trend that could be used for future predictions or career projections? Some of the results may surprise you.

## Resources Used
-Python with Spyder IDE.
-Tableau
-Basketball Reference

## Methodology
The steps I took to complete this project included web scraping multiple pages on Basketball Reference to create a dataset. I scraped NBA Rookie season stats, per 36 min stats, and the advanced stats.
